# Teo Simulation

This repo contains my first work on simulating TEO using agent-based models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your machine. 
2. Run `python simulation/first_abm_model/run.py` to start the visualisation in the web-server
3. Set the model parameters to the right
4. Click on `start` in the top right corner to start the simulation and run it until you want to stop the simulation.
